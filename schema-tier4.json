By day, I'm a mother of three, a wife, and a full-time professional who has built a career I'm proud of. But by night, I lose myself in the world of magic, intrigue, and adventure. I've always been a lover of fantasy, drawn to rich worlds and characters that linger long after the last page. When a story took root in my mind -- a tale of hidden magic, wolf shifters, and a heroine torn between duty and destiny -- I knew I had to write it. Now, I'm bringing that world to life, and I can't wait for you to step into the shadows with me. Also, I'm a devoted pet lover -- because every great fantasy world needs a loyal companion."

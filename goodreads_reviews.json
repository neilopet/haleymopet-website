    "text": "<br />Thank you to Nerd Fam for sending me this copy of A Bloodveiled Decent for the month. This book….wow. All I have to say is wow! From beginning to end, I was hooked! The world building, the dark magic and overall magic system was truly a joy to learn. The characters will have you loving, hating, questioning them all at once but make you fall in love with them allll over again. Evelyn is the embodiment of power. She shows you no matter how life can hurt you and break you down, love and strength can make you stronger. The bond she has with her family, Kaldrek and the wolf pack…it’s definitely unbreakable. <br /><br />This is by far one of my favorite ARC reads of the year and Haley Opet has become one of my favorite authors so far. Her writing style id so addictive and captivating that I’m still in awe and I want more!!! I can not wait for the book two and to see where this new journey leads.<br /><br />Also the cliff hanger at the end….😳",

    "text": "This book is incredible.<br />I had to take a walk after I finished it today. <br />It’ll be awhile before I get my jaw off the floor.<br />It starts slow - we get a lot of background, character and world building - which is actually very enjoyable. You meet Evelyn, who at 22 is rapidly approaching spinsterhood, much to her well-off family’s chagrin. Not because of anything wrong with Evelyn herself, but because for years her focus has been on her sickly younger brother, Cillian.<br />Out of desperation her parents are ready to arrange her marriage to a gross older man but luckily her best friend, Alaric, a neighboring young man, saves her in more ways than one and they become betrothed.<br />But secrets have a way of destroying things in Evelyn’s life and then when Cillian suddenly disappears, she gives up everything to go save him.<br />What follows is as far from the first part of the book as you can imagine! <br />Haley Opet has written what I KNOW will become the next big thing in fantasy fiction! I cannot wait for the sequel ands I’m so incredibly grateful to have been gifted the arc by The Nerd Fam!<br />A million stars!",

    "text": "<i>A Bloodveiled Descent</i> by Haley Opet is a true “don’t judge a book by its cover” fantasy epic.<br /><br />I devoured this novel in one day, to the dismay of my 5:30 a.m. alarm clock, and I haven’t stopped thinking about Lady Evelyne Duskwood since. Her transformation from a typical lady laced in corsets to a dagger wielding demon slayer was nothing short of captivating.<br /><br />Evelyne, a twenty-two-year-old second daughter of Lord Duskwood, faces the end of her independence as her parents pressure her to find a husband this season. Her elder sister the ever perfect Lady Aurelia frustrates her to no end, but her wonderful handmaiden is there to ground her. To preserve the secrets of Northern magic between two aristocratic families, she is set to marry her closest friend, Alaric. But their betrothal is shattered in one of the most heartbreaking betrayals I have read in some time. My heart ached for her pain, and when she still called him her “closest friend,” it hurt even more. Despite his later efforts to redeem himself and help her on her journey, I could not forgive him. The addition of Calista to the betrayal made it even more devastating. Credit to the author for writing a wonderful scene that made me feel the betrayal rather than simply read it.<br /><br />Cillian, Evelyne’s delicate and studious brother, is afflicted by illness, and their bond is beautifully rendered. Her fierce protectiveness of him gave her character incredible depth. The introduction of Kaldrek’s shifter pack elevated this story even higher. His loyalty, strength, and devotion to his pack were perfectly portrayed, and I adored him from his very first appearance. Evelyne’s fiery defiance when he entered her tent, and his immediate respect for her because of it, made me love them both even more.<br /><br />The worldbuilding is rich and dark, filled with magic, monsters, dying wonderful customs. The tone blends historical fantasy with gothic horror, and I was shocked by how truly evil Vaelora was. Some of the deaths struck unexpectedly hard, and the grief felt raw and real.<br /><br />I do not give five stars easily, but <i>A Bloodveiled Descent</i> completely transfixed me. I could not stop reading and am already eagerly waiting for book two.<br /><br />A small note for clarity: consider adding a brief marker for Cillian’s point-of-view transitions, as it was a bit confusing at first. And while the cover is stunning, I do not know who the male figure is, and I hope it is not Kaldrek. Consider removing the character images altogether.<br /><br /><br /><b>I received an ARC on Reedsy Discovery.</b><br /> ",

    "text": "Thank you to the Nerd Fam and Haley M. Opet for the eARC of this book!<br /><br />This book was brilliant. The world-building is exquisite, starting with a solid Regency-style setting that gives major Bridgerton vibes. The first third of the story is a bit slower, but it’s essential for establishing the main characters and their motivations. We meet Evelyne, a 22-going-on-23-year-old navigating yet another courting season; Alaric, her closest friend; and Cillian, her 20-year-old brother who is suffering from an unknown illness. This opening section lays a strong foundation, providing rich backstory and introducing the hidden magic threaded through the world.<br /><br />Parts two and three dive fully into the magical elements, shifting away from Regency vibes and into something even more captivating. The character development is phenomenal, new characters are introduced seamlessly, and the growth of the existing cast is handled masterfully.<br /><br />The world-building continues to shine throughout the second and third parts. Witches, shifters, and all manner of terrifying creatures populate the pages, yet it never feels overwhelming. The multiple POVs are used effectively, enhancing both the story’s depth and the characters’ emotional arcs.<br /><br />There’s a perfect slow-burn romance, fated-mate tension, and a villain you can’t help but despise from the very beginning.<br /><br />And that ending? Absolutely wrecked me. I need book two ASAP!",

    "text": "The way I did not expect this to be a 5+ star read! The beginning had me a bit worried thinking this was going to just be another time era piece with fantasy elements and I've read dozens of those so I wasn't really expecting much.. but after about 50 pages, I realized that this was going to be so much more than I thought! This gave me the feeling of 'if twilight was told back when Bella was learning about the packs and this is a story of someone kind of similar to her' and what I mean by that is we start off not believing magic and fairytales being real and dealing with crazy family expectations and then discovering its all in fact real and traveling with the wolf shifters and I've got to hush before I give spoilers LOL. Basically, this was for the girlie's who like a more polished, intellectual fantasy read but still thirst for romantic connections and a dash of spice. This was a slow burn and things didnt instantly connect, an authentic relationship is established here, its not just an instalove. And the storyline itself was wicked cool! It was not an average fantasy read for me and I flew threw it in a couple hours.<br /><br />Thank you Netgalley for the ARC",

    "text": "From elegant dances in high-society halls to perilous chases through dark, magic-tainted woods, this story had me hooked. The FMC’s resilience shines! She endures so much yet continues to push forward, staying true to those she loves. The MMC might seem like your typical alpha at first, but there’s so much more to him beneath the surface. Told primarily from Evelyn’s POV, with a few others woven in, the story’s world-building and character relationships felt natural and well-developed. The ending left me eager and a little impatient for the next book!",

I didn't even see them coming! <br />I loved our main Character Evelyn, because she was unapologetically herself. Even if she was different than others, she stood strong in who she was and didnt waver for the opinions of others. Her devotion to her brother made me cry more than once as an older sister. <br />The world building captured my attention instantly, but the adventures of the second half of the book really cemented my 5 star rating. I love a good adventure arc and this book did it perfectly! <br /><br />If you love a strong opinioned FMC, witty banter and a whirlwind adventure with plot twists you never see coming, this book is for you! <br />Can't wait for book 2!!",

    "text": "From the very first chapter, I was completely immersed in this intricately crafted world of unforgettable characters.<br /><br /><i>There’s something wrong with Cillian. My brother has always been quiet and studious, but when he starts falling into trances, hallucinating, I’m expected to dismiss it and keep playing the part of the demure lady, smiling prettily to secure a husband. But I can’t ignore the signs. I’ve seen it, an inky mist creeping along the halls in the night. Something is happening. Something sinister. Something unnatural. And when I wake one morning to find Cillian gone, everything changes in an instant. I won’t sit idle while the darkness takes him. I will find him, I will bring him back, and nothing will stand in my way.</i><br /><br />This was amazing! Part 1 is a slow build, filled with court-life drama, people scheming and trying to snare a suitable husband, while a subtle thread of magic weaves quietly through everything. It lays a strong foundation with likable characters and plenty of magical intrigue. Then in Parts 2 and 3, the story deepens. We encounter witchy villains, monsters, training sequences, shifters, seers, everything you could want. The world expands, the stakes rise, and the characters grow and evolve, turning the tale into a sweeping, epic adventure.<br /><br />The writing completely ensnared me. There was something about it that made me read faster and faster. I couldn’t get enough. I also really appreciated the multiple POVs. They were handled seamlessly, giving such a well-rounded view of the story.<br /><br />Evelyne Duskwood was phenomenal. A proper noble lady who never truly fit in with the stuffy court. She was full of heart, determination, and that perfect touch of stubbornness we love in an FMC. She truly comes into her own, transforming into a warrior, a force to be reckoned with. Alaric, her best friend and ex-fiance, is exactly the kind of too-handsome, flirty, infuriating character who, deep down, is so much more. His POV added incredible depth to his character, and I can’t wait to see more of him in book two.<br /><br />Then we have Kaldrek, alpha of the Ironwolf pack who captures and later trains Evelyne and Alaric. He’s strong, brutish, and utterly captivating. Kaldrek and Evelyne’s slow burn was perfection, building into searing heat, and I loved every second of watching it consume them. <br /><br />I devoured this, and that ending has me absolutely desperate for book two!<br />",

Haley M. Opet delivers a dark romantasy full of courtly intrigue, shifter tension, and that perfect mix of beauty and brutality that keeps you reading “just one more chapter” until it’s 2 a.m. (not exaggerating; this actually happened).<br /><br />What I loved:<br />Evelyne Duskwood is everything I love in a heroine: refined and composed on the surface, but fierce and unyielding when her world starts to crumble. The world-building is lush and layered; every kingdom, forest, and demon-haunted border feels alive.<br /><br />And let’s talk about the chemistry. Evelyne and Kaldrek’s dynamic crackles from the start. <br />While I'd call this a mild enemies-to-lovers, it's the kind of electric tension that makes you question every wall the characters build around their hearts. What starts as something that feels a little like insta-love, deepens beautifully once all the truths surface.<br /><br />I also loved the rotating third-person POV (it gave me Throne of Glass vibes in the best way). There are multiple subplots and perspectives, but the author keeps them balanced and easy to follow for no confusion, just richness.<br /><br />Yes, the pacing takes its time to build, but like any regency-inspired slow burn, the payoff is so worth it. And that ending? Let’s just say I’m side-eyeing the calendar waiting for book two because...that cliffhanger!!!<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />A Bloodveiled Descent is a must-read for romantasy lovers who crave fierce heroines, dark secrets, and shifter-tinged tension. If you love when romance and danger walk hand in hand, get this on your TBR STAT.",

She doesn't really care about the parties and being social. She really doesn't want to pick a husband. With her brother, Cillian, strange behavior and needing to be looked after, thats the last thing on her mind. Alaric is Evelyns friend and they are both at the marrying stage. There is more at play than what Eve knows. When her brother goes missing, hidden truths come out and the betrayals sting. A marriage to Alaric, that turns from what she thought was genuine to a trick/arranged. Eve goes out to look for Cillian and rescue him from Vaelora's clutches. Reluctantly teaming up with Alaric, they set out. The Noskari are always watching amd waiting. <br /><br />Enter Kaldrek. The sexy, mysterious, grumpy stranger/captor. Can I just say, we need more Kaldreks in the world. With tension and chemistry brewing between Kaldrek and Evelyn, they set off again, except this time they have new friends that aren't exactly human. Will Evelyn be able to save her brother? Can Evelyn forgive Alaric of his betrayal and move forward? What of Kaldrek? <br /><br />I loved the love, laughter, tension, betrayal, chemistry and found friends in this story. ",

From the moment Evelyne’s brother disappears, the story grips you with this eerie sense of mystery that reminded me of the exact feeling I had reading direbound. <br /><br />Evelyne is a fantastic FMC. Watching her shift from a proper noblewoman raised on etiquette into a woman chasing magic, hunting monsters, and unraveling curses was honestly one of my favorite parts. Her growth felt so natural and emotional, it is hard not to adored her.<br /><br />And the Ironwolf pack? Obsessed. The wolf-shifter lore, the full-moon rituals, the tribal tattoos, the strength-in-unity pack dynamic was amazing. Kaldrek especially stole the show. Dark, brooding, fierce, and protective in that maddening alpha way and the slow-burn between him and Evelyne was chef’s kiss.<br /><br />The writing itself is gorgeous and the ending left me absolutely desperate for book two.<br /><br />If you love immersive fantasy with danger, romance, magic, and wolf-shifter intensity, this will be your next obsession.<br />",

    "text": "Thank you to The Nerd Fam for the gifted eARC. #abloodveileddescent #thenerdfam\"<br /><br />This book was well done and hit all the vibes I need to enjoy a book!<br /><br />It has some world building and character building and growth! Not extremely predictable, so it kept me wondering until closer to the end. <br /><br />There is a scene of attempted sexual abuse, some pretty open sex scenes but not terribly graphic in my opinion (it's not the whole plot) so if you do not like or tolerate does subjects this is not the book for you.<br /><br />I got some Twilight vibes meets Bridgeton vibes! So good!!<br /><br />This book just released yesterday 11/11/2025 and It's on KU!!<br /><br />Tons of magic, witches, wolf shifters and darkness!",

    "text": "This book had so much in it that I loved. It starts off giving historical vibes and then it moves on to magic, witchy and wolf shifter elements tossed in that I really enjoyed. I initially wasn't the biggest fan of Evelyne's sister but she redeemed herself to me. I enjoyed the ups and downs of Evelyne and Alaric's relationship throughout the book with as complicated as it was. I also love the friendships they found along their journey in the book. I had such a hard time putting the book down once I started it, I was hooked so fast. I am looking forward to the next book.",

    "text": "🌒 Dark, lyrical, and utterly captivating Haley M. Opet’s A Bloodveiled Descent is a gothic fantasy that swept me into a world of cursed bloodlines, shadowy forests, and forbidden magic. Evelyne Duskwood is a heroine you root for—sharp, loyal, and unafraid to confront the darkness. The romance is slow-burning and intense, the lore is rich, and the atmosphere is deliciously eerie. Perfect for fans of For the Wolf or Kingdom of the Wicked. I’m already counting down to book two in the Solwyn Duology!",

Thank you so much for the eARC and will be waiting for the next release 👀",

There was banter, fated mates, blood magic, slow burn, and an Alpha Romance. Yes, please! Let's not forget the jaw dropping twists. I did not see them coming...any of them! <br /><br />Highly recommend!! Can't wait for book #2...I need it now!<br />",
